# Lesson Plan\n\n## React\n\n```mdx\n---\ntitle: What is a Hook in React?\n---\n\n# What is a Hook in React?\n\nHooks were added to React in version 16.8 and allow function components to have access to state and other React features.  Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.\n\nAlthough Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.\n\nHooks allow us to \"hook\" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods. You must import Hooks from react.\n\nHere we are using the `useState` Hook to keep track of the application state. State generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked.\n\n## Key Concepts:\n\n*   Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.\n*   Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components.\n*   Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.\n*   React provides a few built-in Hooks like `useState`. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components.\n*   Custom Hooks let you reuse stateful logic between components, but without adding more components to your tree.\n*   If a function’s name starts with `use` and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook.\n*   It is now suggested to use Function components along with Hooks.\n\n## Rules for Hooks\n\nThere are 3 rules for hooks:\n\n1.  *Rule 1*\n2.  *Rule 2*\n3.  *Rule 3*\n\nHooks will not work in React class components.\n\nIf you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components, you can build your own custom Hooks.\n```\n\n```mdx\n---\ntitle: Why Components in React?\ndescription: Understanding the role and importance of components in React's architecture for building UIs.\n---\n\n# Why Components in React?\n\nReact utilizes components to construct user interfaces from discrete, reusable, and maintainable units. Let's explore why components are foundational to React's architecture.\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n*   **Building Blocks:** React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.\n*   **Reusability:** Components are independent and reusable bits of code. React is all about re-using code, and it is recommended to split your components into separate files.\n*   **Composability:** React is designed to let you seamlessly combine components written by independent people, teams, and organizations. Components can refer to other components in their output.\n*   **Maintainability:** Putting JSX markup close to related rendering logic makes React components easy to create, maintain, and delete. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.\n*   **Data Flow:** React components receive data and return what should appear on the screen. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed via `this.props`.\n\n## Component Responsibilities\n\n*   **Rendering UI:** Components implement a `render()` method that takes input data and returns what to display. The `render` method should specify what you want to appear on the screen\n*   **State Management:** In addition to taking input data (accessed via `this.props`), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via `this.state`). When a component’s state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking `render()`. `setState enqueues changes to the component state. It tells React that this component and its children need to re-render with the new state.`\n*   **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Components are important in React due to the abstraction and encapsulation of logic, state, and presentation.\n*   **Modular Error Handling:** Describes error boundaries, which are components that prevent the entire UI from crashing when an error occurs.\n\n## Component Types\n\n*   **Function Components:** Function components along with Hooks are a fundamental way to manage state and logic in React. Function components also return HTML, and behave much the same way as a Class component,\n    but Function components can be written using much less code,\n    are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this tutorial.\n\n## Component Structure\n\n*   When creating a React component, the component's name MUST start with an upper case letter.\n*   `Component is the base class for the React components`.\n\n## Benefits of Using Components\n\n*   Components allow building complex UIs out of smaller, reusable, and manageable pieces.\n*   Helps in reusing stateful logic between components\n*   Reusability pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component.\n*   The same component abstraction can be used for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.\n*   Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.\n\n```mdx\n\n
