# Dynamic Programming: A Comprehensive Guide

Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and an algorithmic paradigm. It simplifies complex problems by breaking them down into simpler, overlapping sub-problems in a recursive manner. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of dynamic programming, covering its applications, key concepts, and examples.


## Overview


### Mathematical Optimization

In mathematical optimization, dynamic programming typically involves simplifying a decision by breaking it down into a sequence of decision steps over time.

This is achieved by defining a sequence of value functions V1, V2, ..., Vn, where each Vi takes y as an argument representing the state of the system at times i from 1 to n. The definition of Vn(y) represents the value obtained in state y at the last time n. The values Vi at earlier times i = n − 1, n − 2, ..., 2, 1 can be found by working backwards, using a recursive relationship called the Bellman equation.

For i = 2, ..., n, Vi −1 at any state y is calculated from Vi by maximizing a simple function (usually the sum) of the gain from a decision at time i − 1 and the function Vi at the new state of the system if this decision is made. Since Vi has already been calculated for the needed states, the above operation yields Vi −1 for those states. Finally, V1 at the initial state of the system is the value of the optimal solution. The optimal values of the decision variables can be recovered, one by one, by tracking back the calculations already performed.


### Control Theory

In control theory, a typical problem involves finding an admissible control u* which causes the system x˙(t) = g(x(t), u(t), t) to follow an admissible trajectory x* on a continuous time interval t0 ≤ t ≤ t1 that minimizes a cost function J = b(x(t1), t1) + ∫t0t1 f(x(t), u(t), t) dt.

The solution to this problem is an optimal control law or policy u* = h(x(t), t), which produces an optimal trajectory x* and a cost-to-go function J*. The latter obeys the fundamental equation of dynamic programming: -J*t = min u {f(x(t), u(t), t) + J*xTg(x(t), u(t), t)}, a partial differential equation known as the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation.


### Computer Science

Dynamic programming is applicable to problems exhibiting two key attributes: optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems.

Optimal substructure means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Overlapping sub-problems means that the space of sub-problems must be small, i.e., any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems.

This can be achieved through either of two approaches:


- **Top-down approach (Memoization):** Store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table (often an array or hashtable). Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved.

- **Bottom-up approach (Tabulation):** Solve the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form.


### Bioinformatics

Dynamic programming is widely used in bioinformatics for tasks such as sequence alignment, protein folding, RNA structure prediction, and protein-DNA binding.


## Examples: Computer Algorithms


### Dijkstra's Algorithm for the Shortest Path Problem

From a dynamic programming perspective, Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem is a successive approximation scheme that solves the dynamic programming functional equation for the shortest path problem by the Reaching method.

Dijkstra's explanation of the logic is a paraphrasing of Bellman's Principle of Optimality.


### Fibonacci Sequence

Using dynamic programming greatly improves the performance of calculating the *n*th member of the Fibonacci sequence.

Here is a naive implementation based on the mathematical definition:

```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
```

This naive approach leads to exponential time complexity due to recalculating the same values multiple times.

Now, suppose we use memoization:

```python
m = {0: 0, 1: 1}

def fib(n):
    if n not in m:
        m[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    return m[n]
```

This memoization technique significantly reduces the time complexity to O(n).

In the bottom-up approach:

```python
def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    else:
        previous_fib = 0
        current_fib = 1
        for _ in range(n - 1):
            new_fib = previous_fib + current_fib
            previous_fib = current_fib
            current_fib = new_fib
        return current_fib
```

This approach also uses O(n) time but only takes constant O(1) space.


### Checkerboard

Consider a checkerboard with _n_ × _n_ squares and a cost function `c(i, j)` which returns a cost associated with square `(i,j)`. Let's define `q(i, j)` as the minimum cost to reach square `(i, j)`.

```
q(i,j) = {
    infinity if j < 1 or j > n
    c(i,j) if i = 1
    min(q(i-1,j-1), q(i-1,j), q(i-1,j+1)) + c(i,j) otherwise
}
```

The code for this is:

```python
def min_cost(i, j):
  if j < 1 or j > n:
    return float('inf')
  elif i == 1:
    return c(i, j)
  else:
    return min(min_cost(i-1, j-1), min_cost(i-1, j), min_cost(i-1, j+1)) + c(i, j)
```


### Sequence Alignment

In genetics, sequence alignment is an important application where dynamic programming is essential.

The problem can be stated naturally as a recursion, a sequence A is optimally edited into a sequence B by either:

1. inserting the first character of B, and performing an optimal alignment of A and the tail of B

2. deleting the first character of A, and performing the optimal alignment of the tail of A and B

3. replacing the first character of A with the first character of B, and performing optimal alignments of the tails of A and B.

Different variants exist, like the Smith–Waterman algorithm and Needleman–Wunsch algorithm.


### Egg Dropping Puzzle

A dynamic programming functional equation for the egg dropping puzzle involves states of the form (n,k), where n represents the number of eggs and k represents the number of floors to test.

W(n ,k) is the minimum number of trials required to identify the critical floor under the worst-case scenario.

W(n ,k) = 1 + min{max(W(n − 1, x − 1), W(n ,k − x)): x = 1, 2, ..., k } with W(n ,0) = 0 for all n > 0 and W(1,k) = k for all k.


### Matrix Chain Multiplication

Matrix chain multiplication demonstrates the utility of dynamic programming for optimizing the order of matrix multiplications. The goal is to minimize the number of scalar multiplications.

Let's call m[i,j] the minimum number of scalar multiplications needed to multiply a chain of matrices from matrix i to matrix j.

If i = j, m[i,j] = 0. If i < j, m[i,j] = min over all possible values of k (m[i,k] + m[k+1,j] + pi-1 * pk * pj) where k ranges from i to j - 1.


## Conclusion

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping sub-problems. Its applications span various fields, including computer science, economics, and bioinformatics. By understanding the core principles and examples, you can effectively apply dynamic programming to solve complex problems.
